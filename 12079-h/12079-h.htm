<h2>CHARIVARIA</h2>
.
<p>No enthusiasm attended the recent revival of the curious May Day
custom of dancing round the snow man.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Since the Muzzling Order, says a weekly paper, fewer postmen in
the West End have been bitten by dogs. We are asked by the Dogs'
Trade Union to point out that this is not due to the Muzzling
Order, but to the fact that just at present there is a fine supply
of dairy-fed milkmen in that district.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A negress has just died in South America, aged 136. It is
supposed that the exodus of so many of her descendants to London on
account of the great demand for Jazz-band players was largely
responsible for hastening her end.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>According to a local paper an American officer refused to stay
at a seaside hotel during Easter-time because a flea hopped on to
the visitors' book whilst he was in the act of signing it. We agree
that it is certainly rather alarming when these unwelcome intruders
adopt such methods of espionage in order to discover which room one
is about to occupy.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The Society of Public Analysts declares that it is impossible to
tell what animal or what part of it is contained in a sausage. We
gather that it all depends on whether the beast is backed into the
machine or enticed into it with a sardine.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The British people still feel themselves the victors, so Mr.
RAMSAY MACDONALD told the <i>Vossische Zeitung</i>. Not Mr.
MACDONALD'S fault, of course.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>London butchers have protested against being compelled to sell
Chilian, Brazilian, Manchurian <i>and other</i> beef. A simple way
to distinguish "other beef" from Manchurian beef is to offer it to
the cat. If it eats it, it is neither.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The Board of Agriculture claims that since 1914 eleven thousand
persons have been taught to make cheese. It is admitted, however,
that as the result of inexperience the mortality among young
cheeses has been enormous.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The Labour Party are submitting a Motion in the House of Commons
for the reduction of railway fares. An alternative suggestion that
passengers should be allowed to pay the extra shilling or two and
buy the train outright will probably be put forward.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The sum of &pound;15,650 has just been paid for the lease of a
West End flat, says a contemporary. If this includes use of the
bath, it seems a bit of a bargain.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>We gather from an American newspaper that shooting for the new
Mexican Presidency has commenced.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>An East End fishmonger is reported to have sold fish at one
penny a pound. The controlled price being much higher, several
trade rivals have offered to bear the expense of a doctor for this
man as they feel that something may be pressing on his brain.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A Berlin message indicates that the man who shot KURT EISNER has
again been assassinated by the Spartacists. This, of course, cannot
be the end of the business. The last and positively final execution
of the man still rests with the German Government.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>There has never been a case of rabies in Scotland, says <i>The
Evening News</i>. This speaks well for the bagpipes as a defensive
weapon.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>According to a Boston message some Americans gave Admiral WOOD,
U.S. Navy, a very cool reception the other day. In shaking hands
with him they only broke seven small bones.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>We are pleased to be able to say that the recently demobilised
soldier who accidentally swallowed some "plum and apple" in a
London restaurant is well on the road to recovery.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The number of hot-cross-bun specialists who, since Easter, have
been in receipt of unemployment pay has not yet been disclosed for
publication.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A dog has returned to its home at Walsworth after being absent
for two months. It is feared that he has been leading a double
life.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Throughout the country," says a well-known daily paper, "the
hedges and trees are now budding forth into green leaves." This, we
understand, is according to precedent.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Is your rent raised?" asks a contemporary. With difficulty, if
he <i>must</i> know.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Newcastle Justices have extinguished eight licences for
redundancy. There is no reason for supposing that the offence was
intentional.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The report that the prehistoric flint axe recently found at
Ascot had been claimed by Sir FREDERICK BANBURY, M.P., is denied.
Sir FREDERICK, it appears, merely expressed warm approval of
it.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The Manchester Parks Committee is considering the question of
opening the Municipal Golf Links for Sunday play. It is contended
that the more anti-Sabbatarian features of the game could be
eliminated by allowing players to pick out of a bunker without
penalty.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Much advice has recently appeared in the Press regarding the
treatment of bites received from mad dogs, and in consequence there
is a movement on foot among Missionaries to obtain some information
regarding the best method of treating the bite of a cannibal.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A Chicago woman has been charged with attempting to shoot her
husband with a jewelled and gold-handled revolver. We are pleased
to note that the American authorities are determined to put down
such ostentation.</p>

<h2>LETTERS TO PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW.</h2>
<p class="center"><i>(No answers required, thank you.)</i></p>
<p class="center"><i>To Count Brockdorff-Rantzau, Head of the German Peace
Delegation.</i></p>
<p>The enthralling volume, entitled <i>Preliminary Terms of
Peace</i>, on which your attention is being engrossed at the
present moment, is said to be of the same length as <i>A Tale of
Two Cities</i>. In other respects there is little resemblance
traceable between the two works. A more striking likeness is to be
found between the present volume and a document produced (also in
the neighbourhood of Paris) by the late Prince BISMARCK in 1871. On
your return home, if the fancy appeals to you, you might, out of
these two publications, construct a very readable romance and call
it <i>Two Tales of One City</i>. I think this would be a better
name for it than <i>Vice-Versailles.</i></p>
<p class="center"><i>To Signor Orlando</i>.</p>
<p>Apart from our love for Italy we are, of course, naturally
prejudiced in favour of a man who got his surname from one of our
own SHAKSPEARE'S heroes, and has consequently given us several easy
chances of making little <i>As-you-like-it</i> jokes for the Press
in our simple unsophisticated way. All the same I think you were
wrong in dropping out of the Big Four like that. If every other
Allied delegate were to go off home whenever he couldn't get his
own way, or whenever he differed from President WILSON, there might
be nobody left to meet the German representatives or to sign any
sort of Peace terms. The enemy might even start a Big Four of their
own and begin to talk. What should we do then? We might have to
send for Marshal FOCH. I'm not sure that in any case this wouldn't
be the best plan.</p>
<p>But perhaps you will be back in Paris before this letter reaches
you. All roads lead to Rome, and there must be at least one that
leads out of it again.</p>
<p class="center"><i>To Ferdinand, Fox</i>.</p>
<p>If news of the outside world ever reaches you in your earth, and
you read the discussions on the question whether your old friend
WILLIAM ought to be hanged, it can hardly have escaped Your
Nosiness that nothing is said about your own claim to similar
treatment. Those who never rightly appreciated you may imagine that
you will meekly consent to forgo that claim. But, if I know
anything of your proud and princely nature, you are, on the other
hand, bitterly chagrined at the thought that you have been
forgotten so soon.</p>
<p class="center"><i>To a British "Sportsman</i>."</p>
<p>I have often seen you of an afternoon in war-time hanging about
in groups along my workaday street, poring over what you regarded
as the vital news of the day. It was not a report of any battle in
which your brothers were fighting, and, if I had asked you
breathlessly, "Who won?" you would not have said, "The British";
you would have said, "SOLLY JOEL'S colt." You had never seen the
horse, but you had half-a-dollar of your War-bonus on him, or more
probably on one of those who also ran. To-day there are no silly
battles to take up good space in your evening print; and, better
still, there is no day without its racing matter; no more
curtailing of the King of Sports to the lamentable detriment of our
national horse-breeding, a subject so close to your heart. The War
is indeed well over.</p>
<p>And nothing can be more gratifying to you than to note the rapid
progress of Reconstruction in the domain of the Turf. In other
spheres of activity there may be a million people drawing the
unemployment donation; but here there is immediate occupation for
all. The New Jerusalem has been built in a day.</p>
<p class="center"><i>To Peace</i>.</p>
<p>You must not mind if, when you come at last, we treat you like
an anti-climax. You see, we let ourselves go, once for all, over
the Armistice, and, though there will be plenty of celebrations for
you, we shan't forget ourselves again. There will be bands, of
course, and bunting, and we shall read the directions in the
papers, and buy expensive tickets and get to our seats early. But
we shall be respectable and inarticulate this time, like the
present exhibition at the Royal Academy. Besides, we have no nice
things to shout when the pageants go by, like "<i>Vive la
Victoire</i>!" or "<i>Viva la Pace!</i>" and even if we had we
should all wait for somebody else to start shouting them.</p>
<p>But you are not to be disappointed; we shall really be glad to
welcome you, though we do it in that strange way we have of taking
everything as it comes.</p>
<p>I suppose you are bound to assist at your own celebrations,
otherwise I should recommend you to be content to read about them
next day&mdash;about the thundering cheers, the wild enthusiasm
that swept like a flame through the vast multitudes, and how "the
red glare on Skiddaw roused the Canon (RAWNSLEY) of Carlisle."</p>
<p class="center"><i>To a Multi-Millionaire.</i></p>
<p>It must be a great satisfaction to you to see how highly the
CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER appreciates the loss which the country
will sustain by your eventual decease; and that he has proposed to
increase materially the amount to be raised out of your estate as a
national souvenir of your commercial activities. Indeed you may
reflect that, splendid and profitable as your life has been,
nothing in it will have become you so much as the leaving of it.
With such a thought in your mind the prospect of death should be
robbed of a large proportion of its sting.</p>
<p class="center"><i>To a New Knight (Scots).</i></p>
<p>Out of the eight hundred million pounds' worth of Government
material left over from the War, of which two hundred million
pounds' worth is expected to be realised in the current year, you
should have no difficulty in securing a pair of knightly spurs at
quite a reasonable price. They ought to go well with a kilt.</p>
<p class="center"><i>To the Chairman of the "Soci&eacute;t&eacute;
des Bains de Mer de Monaco</i>."</p>
<p>Few people can have been better pleased than you at the
cessation of hostilities. During all those terrible years the
falling-off among the patrons of your world-famous
bathing-establishment must have been a source of cruel grief to
you. And now there are already myriads who have washed away the
stains of war in the pellucid waves that lap your coast of
azure.</p>
<p>Here, too, at your hospitable Board of Green Cloth there is
forgetfulness of Armageddon save when the cry of "Z&eacute;ro"
recalls to the convalescent British warrior the fateful hour for
going over the top.</p>
<p>And to think of Monte Carlo without the guttural Hun and his
raucous "<i>Dass ist mein</i>" as he swoops upon his disputed
spoils! An Eden with the worm away!</p>

<h2>THE ARRIVAL OF BLACKMAN'S WARBLER.</h2>
<p>I am become an Authority on Birds. It happened in this way.</p>
<p>The other day we heard the Cuckoo in Hampshire. (The next
morning the papers announced that the Cuckoo had been heard in
Devonshire&mdash;possibly a different one, but in no way superior
to ours except in the matter of its Press agent.) Well, everybody
in the house said, "Did you hear the Cuckoo?" to everybody else,
until I began to get rather tired of it; and, having told everybody
several times that I <i>had</i> heard it, I tried to make the
conversation more interesting. So, after my tenth "Yes," I added
quite casually:&mdash;</p>
<p>"But I haven't heard the Tufted Pipit yet. It's funny why it
should be so late this year."</p>
<p>"Is that the same as the Tree Pipit?" said my hostess, who
seemed to know more about birds than I had hoped.</p>
<p>"Oh, no," I said confidently.</p>
<p>"What's the difference exactly?"</p>
<p>"Well, one is tufted," I said, doing my best, "and the
other&mdash;er&mdash;climbs trees."</p>
<p>"Oh, I see."</p>
<p>"And of course the eggs are more speckled," I added, gradually
acquiring confidence.</p>
<p>"I often wish I knew more about birds," she said regretfully.
"You must tell us something about them now we've got you here."</p>
<p>And all this because of one miserable Cuckoo!</p>
<p>"By all means," I said, wondering how long it would take to get
a book about birds down from London.</p>
<p>However, it was easier than I thought. We had tea in the garden
that afternoon, and a bird of some kind struck up in the
plane-tree.</p>
<p>"There, now," said my hostess, "what's that?"</p>
<p>I listened with my head on one side. The bird said it again.</p>
<p>"That's the Lesser Bunting," I said hopefully.</p>
<p>"The Lesser Bunting," said an earnest-looking girl; "I shall
always remember that."</p>
<p>I hoped she wouldn't, but I could hardly say so. Fortunately the
bird lesser-bunted again, and I seized the opportunity of playing
for safety.</p>
<p>"Or is it the Sardinian White-throat?" I wondered. "They have
very much the same note during the breeding season. But of course
the eggs are more speckled," I added casually.</p>
<p>And so on for the rest of the evening. You see how easy it
is.</p>
<p>However the next afternoon a most unfortunate occurrence
occurred. A real Bird Authority came to tea. As soon as the
information leaked out I sent up a hasty prayer for bird-silence
until we had got him safely out of the place; but it was not
granted. Our feathered songster in the plane-tree broke into his
little piece.</p>
<p>"There," said my hostess&mdash;"there's that bird again." She
turned to me. "What did you say it was?"</p>
<p>I hoped that the Authority would speak first, and that the
others would then accept my assurance that they had misunderstood
me the day before; but he was entangled at that moment in a
watercress sandwich, the loose ends of which were still waiting to
be tucked away.</p>
<p>I looked anxiously at the girl who had promised to remember, in
case she wanted to say something, but she also was silent.
Everybody was silent except that miserable bird.</p>
<p>Well, I had to have another go at it. "Blackman's Warbler," I
said firmly.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," said my hostess.</p>
<p>"Blackman's Warbler; I shall always remember that," lied the
earnest-looking girl.</p>
<p>The Authority, who was free by this time, looked at me
indignantly.</p>
<p>"Nonsense," he said; "it's the Chiff-chaff."</p>
<p>Everybody else looked at me reproachfully. I was about to say
that "Blackman's <span class="pagenum"><a name="page357" id=
"page357"></a>[pg 357]</span> Warbler" was the local name for the
Chiff-chaff in our part of Flint, when the Authority spoke
again.</p>
<p>"The Chiff-chaff," he said to our hostess with an insufferable
air of knowledge.</p>
<p>I wasn't going to stand that.</p>
<p>"So <i>I</i> thought when I heard it first," I said, giving him
a gentle smile.</p>
<p>It was now the Authority's turn to get the reproachful
looks.</p>
<p>"Are they very much alike?" my hostess asked me, much
impressed.</p>
<p>"Very much. Blackman's Warbler is often mistaken for the
Chiff-chaff, even by so-called experts"&mdash;and I turned to the
Authority and added, "Have another sandwich, won't you?"&mdash;"and
particularly so, of course, during the breeding season. It is true
that the eggs are more speckled, but&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Bless my soul," said the Authority, but it was easy to see that
he was shaken, "I should think I know a Chiff-chaff when I hear
one."</p>
<p>"Ah, but do you know a Blackman's Warbler? One doesn't often
hear them in this country. Now in Switzerland&mdash;"</p>
<p>The bird said "Chiff-chaff" again with an almost indecent
plainness of speech.</p>
<p>"There you are!" I said triumphantly. "Listen," and I held up a
finger. "You notice the difference? <i>Obviously</i> a Blackman's
Warbler."</p>
<p>Everybody looked at the Authority. He was wondering how long it
would take to get a book about birds down from London, and deciding
that it couldn't be done that afternoon. Meanwhile "Blackman's
Warbler" sounded too much like the name of something to be
repudiated. For all he had caught of our mumbled introduction I
might have been Blackman myself.</p>
<p>"Possibly you're right," he said reluctantly.</p>
<p>Another bird said "Chiff-chaff" from another tree, and I thought
it wise to be generous. "There," I said, "now that <i>was</i> a
Chiff-chaff."</p>
<p>The earnest-looking girl remarked (silly creature) that it
sounded just like the other one, but nobody took any notice of her.
They were all busy admiring me.</p>
<p>Of course I mustn't meet the Authority again, because you may be
pretty sure that when he got back to his books he looked up
Blackman's Warbler and found that there was no such animal. But if
you mix in the right society and only see the wrong people once it
is really quite easy to be an authority on birds&mdash;or, I
imagine, on anything else.</p>

<h2>THE DOMESTIC QUESTION SOLVED.</h2>
<p>Last Thursday, at a registry-office, I obtained the favour of an
interview with a domestic artist and was able (by reason of a
previous conference with my friend Freshfield&mdash;like myself a
demobilised bachelor author) to face the ordeal with some degree of
confidence.</p>
<p>Mrs. Milton, widow, fifty-five, exceptional references, who
proposed, if everything about me seemed satisfactory, to rule my
household, was as suave as one has any right to expect nowadays;
but when she dictated the terms I gathered that she would be
sufficiently dangerous if roused.</p>
<p>She knew what bachelors were, she did, and wasn't going to take
a place where a lot of comp'ny was kept.</p>
<p>I assured her on this point. My friend, Mr. Freshfield, I said,
would come once a week, every Monday, to dine and sleep, but beyond
that I should put no strain upon her powers of entertainment.</p>
<p>Mrs. Milton further said that she would require at least two
afternoons and one evening a week. Here was my opportunity to
appear generous.</p>
<p>"Two afternoons and one evening?" I said. "My dear friend and
fellow-worker, you can have every Wednesday and Thursday from after
breakfast on the former to practically dinner-time (eight o'clock)
on the latter. No questions will be asked of you or of the piano or
gramophone, both of which instruments you will find in smooth
running order. I am away," I added, "every Wednesday and
Thursday."</p>
<p>That clinched it. Hiding her surprise as well as she could under
an irreproachable bonnet and toupee, Mrs. Milton expressed her
readiness to accompany me then and there, and to superintend the
disappearance of my coals and marmalade.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have guessed that I propose to spend every Wednesday
night at Freshfield's place, and that the complete success of the
scheme has been assured by the making of a similar agreement
between Freshfield and a person holding corresponding views to
those of Mrs. Milton.</p>
<p>Thus Freshfield and I have each secured the full seven days'
attendance by a device pleasing to all concerned. After locking up
the MELBA and GEORGE ROBEY records on Wednesday mornings and with
the knowledge that the piano is past serious injury, I depart for
Freshfield's (<i>vi&acirc;</i> the Club for lunch) each week with a
light heart.</p>
<p>My collaborator is all for keeping this solution of a harassing
problem to ourselves. I say "No." The general adoption of such a
scheme, with alterations to suit individual cases, would, I think,
be a nail in the coffin of Bolshevism in the home.</p>

<h3>THE CHURCH AND PEACE.</h3>
<p>The acquiescence of the Coventry Peace Celebration Committee in
the Bishop of COVENTRY'S view that the Lady GODIVA of their pageant
should be fully clothed is leading not only to many innovations in
the representations of history all over the country, but to a
recrudescence of ecclesiastical power which is affording the
liveliest satisfaction to Lord HUGH CECIL.</p>
<p>For already several other divines have followed suit. It is
agreeable, for example, to the very reasonable wishes of the DEAN
and Chapter of Westminster that the Westminster Peace Celebration
Committee have decided that NELL GWYNN shall either be excluded
from the Whitehall procession altogether or shall figure as a
Mildmay deaconess.</p>
<p>Acting under the influence of a local curate, the Athelney Peace
Celebration Committee have unanimously resolved that in these hard
times, when (as the curate pointed out) food is not too plentiful,
it would be better if KING ALFRED cooked the cakes properly and
they were afterwards distributed.</p>
<p>So many watering-places claim CANUTE as their own that he may be
expected to be multiplied exceedingly in the approaching Peace
revels; but from more than one Pastoral Letter it may be gathered
that the Episcopal Bench is very wisely in favour of the King's
retirement from the margin of the ocean before his shoes are
actually wet. It is held that in these days of leather-shortage and
the need for economy no risks should be run with footwear.</p>
<p>Other laudable efforts in the direction of economy are to be
made, again through the earnest solicitude of the Establishment, in
connection with the impersonation of Sir WALTER RALEIGH and KING
JOHN. With the purpose of saving Sir WALTER'S cloak from stain and
possible injury the puddle at QUEEN ELIZABETH'S feet will be only a
painted one, while, owing to the exorbitant price of laundry-work
at the moment, it has been arranged that only a few of KING JOHN'S
more negligible articles shall be consigned to the Wash.</p>

<h2>THE MUD LARKS.</h2>
<p>"So," said Albert Edward, "I clapped him on the back and said,
'You were at Geelong College in 1910, and your name's Cazenove,
isn't it?'"</p>
<p>"To which he made reply, 'My name's Jones and I never heard of
Geewhizz,' and knocked you down and trod on you for your dashed
familiarity," said the Babe.</p>
<p>"Nothing of the sort. He was delighted to meet me
again&mdash;de-lighted. He's coming to munch with us tomorrow
evening, by the way, so you might sport the tablecloth for once,
William old dear, and tell the cook to put it across Og, the fatted
capon, and generally strive to live down your reputation as the
worst Mess President the world has ever seen. You will, I
know&mdash;for my sake."</p>
<p>Next morning, when I came down to breakfast, I found a note from
him saying that he had gone to the Divisional Races with his dear
old college chum, Cazenove; also the following addenda:&mdash;</p>
<p>"P.S.&mdash;If William should miss a few francs from the Mess
Fund tell him I will return it fourfold ere night. I am on to a
sure thing.</p>
<p>"P.P.S.&mdash;If MacTavish should raise a howl about his fawn
leggings, tell him I have borrowed them for the day as I understand
there will be V.A.D.'s present, and <i>noblesse oblige</i>."</p>
<p>At a quarter past eight that night he returned, accompanied by a
pleasant-looking gunner subaltern, whom we gathered to be the
Cazenove person. I say "gathered," for Albert Edward did not
trouble to introduce the friend of his youth, but, flinging himself
into a chair, attacked his food in a sulky silence which endured
all through the repast. Mr. Cazenove, on the other hand, was in
excellent form. He had spent a beautiful day, he said, and didn't
care who knew it. A judge of horseflesh from the cradle, he had
spotted the winner every time, backed his fancy like a little man
and had been very generously rewarded by the Totalizator. He was
contemplating a trip to Brussels in a day or so. Was his dear old
friend Albert Edward coming?</p>
<p>His "dear old friend" (who was eating his thumb-nails instead of
his savoury) scowled and said he thought not.</p>
<p>The gunner wagged his head sagely. "Ah, well, old chap, if you
will bet on horses which roar like a den of lions you must take the
consequences."</p>
<p>Albert Edward writhed. "That animal used to win sprints in
England; do you know that?"</p>
<p>Mr. Cazenove shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>"He may have thirty years ago. All I'd back him to win now would
be an old-age pension. Well, I warned you, didn't I?"</p>
<p>Albert Edward lost control. "When I'm reduced to taking advice
on racing form from a Tasmanian I'll chuck the game and hie me to a
monkery. Why, look at that bit of bric-&agrave;-brac you were
riding to-day; a decent God-fearing Australian wouldn't be seen
dead in a ten-acre paddock with it."</p>
<p>Mr. Cazenove spluttered even more furiously. "That's a dashed
good horse I'll have you know."</p>
<p>"I am not alluding to his morals, but to his appearance," said
Albert Edward; "I've seen better-looking hat-racks."</p>
<p>"I'd back him to lick the stuffing out of anything you've got in
this unit, anyway," Cazenove snorted.</p>
<p>"Don't be rash, Charlie," Albert Edward warned; "your lucky
afternoon has gone to your head. Why, I've got an old mule here
could give that boneshaker two stone and beat him by a furlong in
five."</p>
<p>The gunner sprang to his feet. "Done with you!" he roared. "Done
with you here and now!"</p>
<p>Albert Edward appeared to be somewhat taken back. "Don't be
silly, man," he soothed. "It's pitch dark outside and cut up with
trenches. Sit down and have some more of this rare old port,
specially concocted for us by the E.F.C."</p>
<p>But Mr. Cazenove was thoroughly aroused. "You're hedging," he
sneered; "you're scared."</p>
<p>"Nonsense," said Albert Edward. "I have never known what fear
is&mdash;not since the Armistice, anyhow. I am one of the bravest
men I have ever met. What are you doing with all that money?"</p>
<p>"Putting it down for you to cover," said Cazenove firmly.</p>
<p>Albert Edward sighed. "All right, then, if you will have it so.
William, old bean, I'm afraid I shall have to trouble you for a
trifle more out of the Mess Fund. <i>Noblesse oblige</i>, you
know."</p>
<p>MacTavish and the Babe departed with the quest to prepare his
mount for the ordeal, while Albert Edward and I sought out
Ferdinand and Isabella, our water-cart pair. Isabella was fast
asleep, curled up like a cat and purring pleasantly, but Ferdinand
was awake, meditatively gnawing through the wood-work of his stall.
With the assistance of the line-guard we saddled and bridled him;
but at the stable door he dug his toes in. It was long past his
racing hours, he gave us to understand, and his union wouldn't
permit it. He backed all round the standings, treading on recumbent
horses, tripping over bails, knocking uprights flat and bringing
acres of tin roofing clattering down upon our heads, Isabella
encouraging him with ringing fanfares of applause.</p>
<p>At length we roused out the grooms and practically carried him
to the starting-point.</p>
<p>"You've been the devil of a time," William grumbled. "Cazenove's
been waiting for twenty minutes. See that light over there? That's
where MacTavish is. He's the winning-post. Keep straight down the
mud-track towards it and you'll be all right. Don't swing sideways
or you'll get bunkered. Form line. Come up the mule. Back,
Cazenove, back! Steady. Go!"</p>
<p>The rivals clapped heels to their steeds and were swallowed up
in the night. I looked at my watch, the hands pointed to 10.30
exactly. William and I lit cigarettes and waited. At 10.42
MacTavish walked into us, his lamp had given out and he wanted a
new battery.</p>
<p>"Who won?" we inquired.</p>
<p>"Won?" he asked. "They haven't started yet, have they?"</p>
<p>"Left here about ten minutes ago," said William. "Do you mean to
say you've seen nothing of them?"</p>
<p>At that moment two loud voices, accompanied by the splash of
liquid and the crash of tin, struck our ears from different points
of the compass.</p>
<p>"Sounds to me as if somebody had found a watery grave over to
the left," said the Babe.</p>
<p>"Sounds to me as if somebody had returned to stables over to the
right," said I.</p>
<p>We trotted away to investigate. 'Twas as I thought; Ferdinand
had homed to his Isabella and was backing round the standings once
more, trailing the infuriated Albert Edward after him, sheets of
corrugated iron falling about them like leaves in Vallombrosa.</p>
<p>"Bolted straight in here and scraped me off against the roof,"
panted the latter. "Suppose the confounded apple-fancier won ages
ago, didn't he?"</p>
<p>"He's upside down in the Tuning Fork trench system at the
present moment," said I. "The Babe and the grooms are digging him
out. If you hurry up you'll win yet."</p>
<p>We roused out the guard, bore the reluctant Ferdinand back to
the course and by eleven o'clock had restarted him. At 11.10
William returned to report that the digging party had salved the
Cazenove pair and got them going again.</p>
<p>"Too late," said I; "Albert Edward must have won in a walk by
now. He left here at ..."</p>
<p>The resounding clatter of falling <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page361" id="page361"></a>[pg 361]</span> sheet-iron cut short my
words. Ferdinand had, it appeared, returned to stables once
more.</p>
<p>Suddenly something hurtled out of the gloom and crashed into us.
It was the Babe.</p>
<p>"What's the matter now? Where are you going?" we asked.</p>
<p>"Wire-cutters, quick!" he gasped and hurtled onwards towards the
saddle-room.</p>
<p>"Hello there!" came the hail of MacTavish from up the course. "I
s-say, what about this blessed race? I'm f-f-rozen s-s-tiff out
here. I'm about f-f-fed up, I t-tell you."</p>
<p>William groaned. "As if we all weren't!" he protested. "If all
the Mess Funds for the next three weeks weren't involved I'd make
the silly fools chuck it. Here, you, run and tell Albert Edward to
get a move on."</p>
<p>I found Ferdinand rapidly levelling the remainder of the
standings, playing his jockey at the end of his reins as a
fisherman plays a salmon.</p>
<p>"This cursed donkey won't steer at all," Albert Edward growled.
"Sideslips all over the place like a wet tyre. Has Cazenove won
yet?"</p>
<p>"Not yet," said I. "He's wound up in the Switch Line wire
entanglements now. The Babe and the wrecking gang are busy chopping
him out. There's still time."</p>
<p>"Then drag Isabella out in front of this brute," said he.
"Quick, man, quick!"</p>
<p>At 11.43, by means of a brimming nose-bag, I had enticed
Isabella forth, and the procession started in the following order:
First, myself, dragging Isabella and dangling the bait. Secondly,
Isabella. Thirdly, the racers, Ferdinand and Albert Edward, the
latter belting Isabella with a surcingle whenever she faltered.
Lastly, the line-guard, speeding Ferdinand with a doubled
stirrup-leather. We toiled down the mud. track at an average
velocity of .25 m.p.h., halting occasionally for Isabella to feed
and the line-guard to rest his arm. I have seen faster things in my
day.</p>
<p>Then, just as we were arriving at our journey's end we collided
with another procession. It was the wrecking gang, laden with the
implements of their trade (shovels, picks, wire-cutters, ropes,
planks, waggon-jacks, etc.), and escorting in their midst Mr.
Cazenove and his battered racehorse. Both competitors immediately
claimed the victory:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Beaten you this time, Albert Edward, old man."... "On the
contrary, Charles, old chap, I won hands down."... "But, my good
fellow, I've been here for hours."... "My dear old thing, I've been
here <i>all night</i>!"... "Do be reasonable."... "Don't be
absurd."</p>
<p>"Oh, dry up, you two, and leave it to the winning-post to
decide," said William.</p>
<p>"By the way, where is the winning-post?"</p>
<p>"The winning-post," we echoed. "Yes, where is he?"</p>
<p>"Begging your pardon, Sir," came the voice of the Mess orderly,
"but if you was referring to Mister MacTavish he went home to bed
half-an-hour ago."</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>
<p><i>Tuesday, April 29th.</i>&mdash;When the House of Commons
re-assembled this afternoon a good many gaps were noticeable on the
green benches. They were not due, however, to the New Year's
Honours, which made a belated appearance this morning, for not a
single Member of Parliament has been ennobled. The notion that not
one of the seven hundred is worthy of elevation is, of course,
unthinkable. But by-elections are so chancy.</p>
<p>Mr. JEREMIAH MACVEAGH still has some difficulty in realising
that the Irish centre of gravity has shifted from Westminster to
Dublin. He indignantly refused to accept an answer to one of his
questions from little Mr. PRATT, and loudly demanded the corporeal
presence of the CHIEF SECRETARY. Mr. MACPHERSON, however, considers
that his duty requires him to remain in Ireland, where Mr.
MACVEAGH'S seventy Sinn Fein colleagues are keeping him
sufficiently busy.</p>
<p>In explaining the swollen estimates of the Ministry of Labour,
Sir ROBERT HORNE pointed out that it is now charged with the
functions formerly appertaining to half-a-dozen other Departments.
He has indeed become a sort of administrative <i>Pooh-Bah</i>.
Unlike that functionary, however, he was not "born sneering." On
the contrary, he made a most sympathetic speech, chiefly devoted to
justifying the much-abused unemployment donation, which accounts
for twenty-five out of the thirty-eight millions to be spent by his
Department this year. But let no one mistake him for a mere HORNE
of Plenty, pouring out benefits indiscriminately upon the genuine
unemployed and the work-shy. He has already deprived some seventeen
thousand potential domestics of their unearned increment, and he
promises ruthless prosecution of all who try to cheat the State in
future.</p>
<p>Criticism was largely silenced by the Minister's frankness. Sir
F. BANBURY, of course, was dead against the whole policy, and
demanded the immediate withdrawal of the civilian grants; but his
uncompromising attitude found little favour. Mr. CLYNES thought it
would have been better for the State to furnish work instead of
doles, but did not explain how in that case private enterprise was
to get going. France's experience with the <i>ateliers
nationaux</i> is not encouraging, though 1919, when "demobbed"
subalterns turn up their noses at &pound;250 a year, is not
1848.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, April 30th.</i>&mdash;Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN,
returning to the Exchequer after an interval of thirteen years,
made a much better Budget speech than one would have expected. It
was longer, perhaps, than was absolutely necessary. Like the late
Mr. GLADSTONE, he has a tendency to digress into financial
backwaters instead of sticking to the main Pactolian stream. His
excursus upon the impracticability of a levy on capital was really
redundant, though it pleased the millionaires and reconciled them
to the screwing-up of the death-duties. Still, on the whole, he had
a more flattering tale to unfold than most of us had ventured to
anticipate, and he told it well, in spite of an occasional
confusion in his figures. After all, it must be hard for a
Chancellor who left the national expenditure at a hundred and fifty
millions and comes back to find it multiplied tenfold not to
mistake millions for thousands now and again.</p>
<p>On the whole the Committee was well pleased with his
performance, partly because the gap between revenue and expenditure
turned out to be a mere trifle of two hundred millions instead of
twice or thrice that amount; partly because there was, for once, no
increase in the income-tax; but chiefly, I think, for the
sentimental reason that in recommending a tiny preference for the
produce of the Dominions and Dependencies Mr. CHAMBERLAIN was
happily combining imperial interests with filial affection.</p>
<p>Almost casually the CHANCELLOR announced that the Land Values
Duties, the outstanding feature of Mr. LLOYD GEORGE'S famous Budget
of 1909, were, with the approval of their author, to be referred to
a Select Committee, to see if anything could be made of them. If
only Mr. ASQUITH had thought of that device when his brilliant
young lieutenant first propounded them! There would have been no
quarrel between the two Houses: the Parliament Act would never have
been passed, and a Home Rule Act, for which nobody in Ireland has a
good word, would not now be reposing on the Statute-Book.</p>
<p>In the absence of any EX-CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER the task of
criticism was left to Mr. ADAMSON, who was mildly aggressive and
showed a hankering after a levy on capital, not altogether easy to
reconcile with his statement that no responsible Member of the
Labour Party desired to repudiate the National Debt. Mr. JESSON, a
National Democrat, was more original and stimulating. As a
representative of the Musicians' Union he is all for harmony, and
foresees the time when Capital and Labour shall unite their forces
in one great national orchestra, under the directing baton of the
State.</p>
<p>At the instance of Lord STRACHIE the House of Lords conducted a
spirited little debate on the price of milk. It appears that there
is a conflict of jurisdiction between the FOOD-CONTROLLER and the
MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, and that the shortage in the supply of
this commodity must be ascribed to the overlapping of the
Departments.</p>

</div>
<p><i>Thursday, May 1st.</i>&mdash;Sinn Fein has decreed that
nobody in Ireland should do any work on May Day. Messrs. DEVLIN and
MACVEAGH, however, being out of the jurisdiction, demonstrated
their independence by being busier than ever. The appointment of a
new Press Censor in Ireland furnished them with many opportunities
at Question-time for the display of their wit, which some of the
new Members seemed to find passably amusing.</p>
<p>Mr. DEVLIN'S best joke was, however, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page366" id="page366"></a>[pg 366]</span>
reserved for the Budget debate, when, in denouncing the further
burdens laid on stout and whisky, he declared that Ireland was,
"apart from political trouble," the most peaceful country in the
world.</p>
<p>The fiscal question always seems to invite exaggeration of
statement. The CHANCELLOR'S not very tremendous Preference
proposals were denounced by Sir DONALD MACLEAN as inevitably
leading to the taxation of food and to quarrels with foreign
countries. Colonel AMERY, on the other hand, waxed dithyrambic in
their praise, and declared that by taking twopence off Colonial tea
the Government were not only consecrating the policy of Imperial
Preference, but were "putting the coping-stone on it."</p>

<h3>A CELTIC COUNTER-BLAST.</h3>
<p>The continued domination of the Russians in the domain of the
ballet has already excited a certain amount of not unfriendly
criticism. But our Muscovite visitors are not to be allowed to have
it all their own way, and we understand that negotiations are
already on foot with a view to enabling the Irish Ballet to give a
season at a leading London theatre in the near future.</p>
<p>The Irish Ballet, which is organised on a strictly
self-determining basis, is one of the outcomes of the Irish
Theatre, but derives in its essentials directly from the school
established by Cormac, son of Art. That is to say it is in its
aims, ideals and methods permeated by the Dalecarlian, Fomorian,
Brythonic and Firbolgian impulse. Mr. Fergal Dindsenchus O'Corkery,
the Director, is a direct descendant of Cuchulinn and only uses the
Ulidian, dialect. Mr. Tordelbach O'Lochlainn, who has composed most
of the ballets in the r&eacute;pertoire, is a chieftain of mingled
Dalcassian and Gallgoidel descent. The scenery has been painted by
Mr. Cathal Eochaid. MacCathamhoil, and the dresses designed by Mr.
Domnall Fothud O'Conchobar.</p>
<p>The artists who compose the troupe have all been trained during
the War at the Ballybunnion School in North Kerry, and combine in a
wonderful way the sobriety of the Delsartean method with the feline
agility of that of Kilkenny. Headed by the bewitching Gormflaith
Rathbressil, and including such brilliant artists as Maeve Errigal,
Coomhoola Grits, Ethne O'Conarchy, Brigit Brandub, Corcu and Mocu,
Diarmid Hy Brasil, Murtagh MacMurchada, Aillil Molt, Mag Mell and
Donnchad Bodb, they form a galaxy of talent which, alike for the
euphony of its nomenclature and the elasticity of its technique,
has never been equalled since the days of ST. VITUS.</p>
<p>We have spoken of the work of Mr. O'Lochlainn, who is
responsible for the three-act ballet, <i>Brian Boruma</i>; a
fantasy on the Brehon laws, entitled <i>The Gardens of Goll;
Poulaphuca</i>, and the <i>Roaring of O'Rafferty;</i> but the
repertory also includes notable and impassioned compositions by
Ossian MacGillycuddy, Aghla Malachy, Carolan MacFirbis and Emer
Sidh. The orchestra employed differs in many respects from that to
which we are accustomed, the wood-wind being strengthened by a
quartet of Firbolg flutes and two Fodlaphones, while the brass is
reinforced by a bass bosthoon, an instrument of extraordinary depth
and sonority, and the percussion by a group of Dingle drums.</p>
<p>But enough has been said to show that the Irish ballet is
assured in advance of a cordial reception from all admirers of the
neo-Celtic genius.</p>

<h3>COLLABORATION.</h3>
<p>Biddick has placed me in a most awkward position. I am a proud
man; I cannot bring myself to accept a gift of money from anybody.
And yet I cannot help feeling I should be justified in taking the
guinea he has sent me.</p>
<p>Biddick is a journalist. I was discussing the inflation of
prices and asking his advice as to how to increase one's income.
"Why not write something for the Press, my dear fellow?" he said.
"Five hundred words with a catchy title; nothing funny&mdash;that's
<i>my</i> line&mdash;but something solid and practical with money
in it; the public's always ready for that. Take your neighbour, old
Diggles, and his mushroom-beds, for instance. Thriving local
industry&mdash;capital copy. Try your hand at half a column, and
call it 'A Fortune in Fungus.'"</p>
<p>"I 'm afraid I know nothing about mushrooms, with the exception
of the one I nearly died of," I replied, "and I'm not sufficiently
acquainted with Mr. Diggles to venture to invite his confidence
respecting his business."</p>
<p>"My dear man, I don't ask you to tell Diggles you're going to
write him up in the newspapers; he'd kick you off the premises; he
doesn't want his secrets given away to competitors. Just dodge the
old man round the sheds, get into conversation with his staff, keep
your eyes open generally and you'll pick up as much as you want for
half a column. And when you've got your notes together bring 'em
along to me. I'll put 'em shipshape for you."</p>
<p>I thanked him very gratefully.</p>
<p>The mushroom-sheds are situated in a field some distance from my
residence, and I found it rather a fatiguing walk. After tedious
watching in a cramped position through a gap in the hedge I saw Mr.
Diggles emerge from a shed and move away from my direction. I lost
no time in creeping forward under cover of my umbrella towards an
employee, who was engaged in tossing manure. I drew out my
note-book and interrogated him briefly and briskly.</p>
<p>"Do you rear from seeds or from cuttings?" I asked him. He
scratched his head and appeared in doubt. "Are your plants
self-supporting," I went on, "or do you train them on twigs? What
would be the diameter of your finest specimen?" He continued in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page367" id="page367"></a>[pg
367]</span> doubt. I adopted a conversational manner. "I suppose
you'll be potting off soon? You must get very fond of your
mushrooms. I think one always gets fond of anything which demands
one's whole care and attention. I wonder if I might have a peep at
your <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;s</i>?"</p>
<p>I edged towards the door of one of the sheds, but he made no
attempt to accompany me. Instead he put his hands to his mouth and
shouted, "Hi, maister!"</p>
<p>Mr. Diggles promptly responded to the summons. There was no
eluding him. I put my note-book out of sight and inquired if he
could oblige me with a pound of fresh-culled mushrooms. He could,
and he did. I paid him four-and-sixpence for them, the control
price presumably, but he gave me no invitation to view the growing
crops. I retraced my steps without having collected even an opening
paragraph for "A Fortune in Fungus."</p>
<p>The next day found me again near the sheds. Mr. Diggles was
nowhere in sight. I approached unobtrusively through the hedge and
accosted a small boy.</p>
<p>"Hulloa, my little man," I said, "what is your department in
this hive of industry? You weed the mushrooms, perhaps, or prune
them?" He seemed shy and offered no answer. "Perhaps you hoe
between the plants or syringe them with insecticide?"</p>
<p>Still I could not win his confidence, so I tried pressing
sixpence into his palm. "Between ourselves, what are the weekly
takings?" I said. He pocketed the coin and put his finger on his
lips.</p>
<p>"<i>Belge,"</i> he said. Then he bolted into a shed and returned
accompanied by Mr. Diggles. There was nothing for it but to
purchase another pound of mushrooms. I was no nearer "A Fortune in
Fungus" than before.</p>
<p>Two days later, having received apparently reliable information
that Mr. Diggles was confined to his bed with influenza, I ventured
again to visit the sheds. I was advancing boldly across the field
when to my consternation he suddenly appeared from behind a
hayrick. I was so startled that I turned to fly, and in my
precipitancy tripped on a tussock and fell. Mr. Diggles came to my
assistance, and, when he had helped me to my feet and brushed me
down with a birch broom he was carrying, I could do nothing less
than buy another pound of his mushrooms.</p>
<p>I felt it was time to consult Biddick. He was sitting at his
desk staring at a blank sheet of paper. His fingers were harrowing
his hair and he looked distraught.</p>
<p>"Excuse the interruption," I said, "but this 'Fortune in Fungus'
is ruining me;" and I related my experience.</p>
<p>At the finish Biddick gripped my hand and spoke with some
emotion. "Dear old chap," he said, "it's my line, after all. It's
funny. If only I can do it justice;" and he shook his
fountain-pen.</p>
<p>This morning I received a guinea and a newspaper cutting
entitled "A Cadger for Copy," which may appeal to some people's
sense of humour. It makes none to mine. In the flap of the envelope
Biddick writes: "Halves, with best thanks."</p>
<p>Upon consideration I shall forward him a simple formal
receipt.</p>

<h2>THE GERM.</h2>
<p>The great Bacteriologist entered the lecture-room and ascended
the platform. A murmur of astonishment ran round the audience as
they beheld, not the haggard face of a man who daily risked the
possibility of being awarded the O.B.E., but the calm and smiling
countenance of one who had succeeded where other scientists, even
of Anglo-American reputation, had failed.</p>
<p>In an awed silence this remarkable man placed on the table a
dish, somewhat like a soup-plate in appearance, and carefully
removed its glass cover.</p>
<p>"In this dish, gentlemen," said the Professor, "we have the
Agar-Agar, which is without doubt the best bacteriological culture
medium yet discovered and is especially useful in growing a
pathogenic organism such as we are about to test this
afternoon."</p>
<p>Then taking a glass rod, to the end of which was attached a
small piece of platinum wire, the lecturer proceeded to scrape a
little of the growth from off the Agar-Agar. Having done this he
quickly deposited it in a test-tube half full of distilled water,
which he then heated over a Bunsen burner. Finally, with the aid of
a hypodermic syringe, a little of the liquid was injected into two
sleepy-looking guinea-pigs, and with bated breath the result of the
test was awaited.</p>
<p>Suddenly, without any warning, the two little animals rose on
their hind legs and violently clutched each other by any part of
the body on which they could get a grip. Before the astounded gaze
of the onlookers they swayed, nearly fell, then went round in
circles, at the same time executing every sort of conceivable
contortion.</p>
<p>A great cheer burst from the audience. From all sides a rush was
made for the platform, and the Professor was carried shoulder-high
round the room.</p>
<p>The Jazz germ had been discovered at last.</p>

<hr />
<h2>LAXITY IN QUOTATIONS.</h2>
<p>Among the many privileges which I propose to claim as a set-off
for what are called advancing years is a greater laxity in
quotation. When I have made a quotation I mean that that shall
<i>be</i> the quotation, and I don't intend to be driven either to
the original source or to cyclopaedias of literature for
verification. DANTE, for instance, is a most prolific fount of
quotations, especially for those who do not know the original
Italian. If I have quoted the words "<i>Galeotto fu il libro e chi
lo scrisse</i>" once, I have quoted them a hundred times, always
with an excellent effect and often giving the impression that I am
an Italian scholar, which I am not. But surely it is not usual to
abstain from a quotation because to use it would give a false
impression? I am perfectly certain, for instance, that there are
plenty of Italians who quote <i>Hamlet</i>, but know no more of
English than the words they quote, so I dare say that brings us
right in the end.</p>
<p>Then there is the quotation about "a very parfitt gentil
knight," or words to that effect. At the moment of writing it down
I felt that my version was so correct that I would go to the
scaffold for it; but at this very instant a doubt insinuates
itself. Is "parfitt" with two "t's" the right spelling?</p>
<p>It is related somewhere that TENNYSON and EDWARD FITZGERALD once
conspired together to see which of them could write the most
Wordsworthian line, and that the result was:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"A Mr. Wilkinson, a clergyman."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But there was no need for TENNYSON to go beyond his own works in
search of such an effect. He had already done the thing; and this
was his effort, which occurs in <i>The May Queen</i>:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"And that good man, the clergyman, has told me words of
peace."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This sounds as if it could not be defeated or matched, but matched
it certainly was in <i>Enoch Arden</i>. After describing <i>Enoch
Arden's</i> death and the manner in which he "roll'd his eyes" upon
<i>Miriam</i>, the bard informs us:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"So past the strong heroic soul away.</p>
<p>And when they buried him the little port</p>
<p>Had seldom seen a costlier funeral."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But I feel that I have strayed beyond my purpose, which was to
claim a certain mitigated accuracy in quotation for those who
suffer from advancing years.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"&mdash;&mdash;, chambermaid at the &mdash;&mdash; Hotel,
&mdash;&mdash;, was charged yesterday with stealing two diamond
rings and a diamond and sapphire broom worth
&pound;80."&mdash;<i>Daily Paper</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet Mr. CHAMBERLAIN refuses to impose a Luxury Tax.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>

Lersner, chief of the preliminary mission and ex-secretary of the

<h3>COMMUNICATIONS.</h3>
<p>I was sitting in the Club, comfortably concealed by sheets of a
well-known journal, when two voices, somewhere over the parados of
the deep arm-chair, broke in upon my semi-consciousness.</p>
<p>"... Then poor old Tubby, who hasn't recovered from his 1918
dose of shell-shock, got a go of claustrophobia and felt he simply
had to get out of the train."</p>
<p>The speaker paused and I heard the clink of glass.</p>
<p>"Well?" said the other voice.</p>
<p>"So, before we could flatten him out, he skipped up and pulled
the communicator thing and stopped the train; consequently we ran
into Town five minutes behind time. There was the deuce of a buzz
about it."</p>
<p>"What's five minutes in this blissful land of lotus-eaters? Why,
I've known the Calais-Wipers express lose itself for half-a-day
without a murmur from anyone, unless the Brigadier had run out of
bottled Bass."</p>
<p>"But, my dear fellow," the first voice expostulated, "this was
the great West of England non-stop Swallowtail; runs into Town
three minutes ahead of time every trip. Habitu&eacute;s of the line
often turn an honest penny by laying odds on its punctuality with
people who are strangers to the reputation of this flier."</p>
<p>"A pretty safe thing to bet on, eh?" said the other voice. Again
there was the faint clink of glass and then the voices drifted into
other topics, to which, having re-enveloped myself in my paper, I
became oblivious.</p>
<p>A few days later I was called away from London, with Mr. Westaby
Jones, to consult in a matter of business. Mr. Westaby Jones is a
member of the Stock Exchange and, amongst other trivial failings,
he possesses one which is not altogether unknown in his profession.
He cannot resist a small wager. On several occasions he has gambled
with me and shown himself to be a gentleman of considerable
acumen.</p>
<p>Our business was finished and we were on the way back to Town by
the great West of England non-stop Swallowtail. We had lunched well
and discussed everything there was to discuss. It was a moment for
rest. I unfolded my paper and proceeded to envelop myself in the
usual way.</p>
<p>I seemed to hear the chink of glasses ... a voice murmured, "A
pretty safe thing to bet on."</p>
<p>Then in a dreamy sort of manner I realised that Fate had
delivered Westaby Jones into my hands. When we were within twenty
miles of London I opened the campaign. I grossly abused the line on
which we were travelling and suggested that anybody could make a
fortune by assuming that its best train would roll in well after
the scheduled time.</p>
<p>Westaby Jones, having privily ascertained that the engine-driver
had a minute or so in hand, immediately pinned me down to what he
thought (but wisely did not say) were the wild inaccuracies of an
imbecile. He did it to the extent of twenty-five pounds, and I sat
back with the comfortable feeling of a man who will shortly have a
small legacy to expend. At the moment which I had calculated to be
most auspicious I suddenly threw off the semblance of boredom, rose
up, lurched across the carriage and pulled the communication cord.
(For the benefit of those who have not done this I may say that the
cord comes away pleasantly in the hand and, at the same time, gives
one a piquant feeling of unofficial responsibility.) Westaby Jones
was, for a stockbroker, obviously astonished.</p>
<p>"What on earth are you doing?" he exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Sit down," I said; "this is my improved exerciser."</p>
<p>"But you'll stop the train," he shouted.</p>
<p>"Never mind," I replied; "what's a fine of five pounds compared
to physical fitness? Besides," I added significantly, "it may be a
good investment after all."</p>
<p>For perhaps twenty seconds there was the silent tension of
expectation in the air and then I realised with a shock that the
train did not show any signs of slackening speed. It was, if
anything, going faster. I snatched frantically at the cord and
pulled about half-a-furlong into the carriage. We flashed past
Ealing like a rocket, and I desperately drew in coils and coils of
the communicator until I and Westaby Jones resembled the Laocoon.
It was no good. Smoothly and irresistibly we glided into the
terminus and drew up at the platform three minutes ahead of
time.</p>
<p>I have paid Westaby Jones, who was unmannerly enough to look
pleased. I have also corresponded with the railway company,
claiming damages on the grounds of culpable negligence.
Unfortunately they require more evidence than I am prepared to
supply of the reasonable urgency of my action.</p>

<p>From a theatre programme:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The name of the actual and responsible Manager of the premises
must be printed at least once during every performance to ensure
its being in proper order."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that explains the noise going on behind the scenes.</p>

<h3>NATURE NOTES.</h3>
<p>The Cuckoo has arrived and will sing as announced.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>One of the results of the arrival of the Cuckoo is the
prevalence of notices, for those that have eyes to see, drawing
attention to the ineligible character of nests. These take a
variety of forms&mdash;such as "All the discomforts of home,"
"Beware of mumps," "We have lost our worm cards," "Serious
lining-shortage"&mdash;but the purpose of each is to discourage the
Cuckoo from depositing an egg where it is not wanted.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>From all parts of the country information reaches us as to the
odd nesting-places of wrens and robins. A curious feature is the
number of cases where letter-boxes have been chosen, thus
preventing the delivery of letters, and in consequence explaining
why so many letters have not been answered. Even the biggest
dilatory correspondent is not ashamed to take advantage of the
smallest bird.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The difficulty of obtaining muzzles is very general and many
dog-owners have been hard put to it to comply with the regulation.
From these, however, must be excepted those who possess wire-haired
terriers, from whose coats an admirable muzzle can be extracted in
a few minutes.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The statement of a telephone operator, that "everything gives
way to trunks," is said to have caused great satisfaction in the
elephant house at the Zoo.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>
<p class="center"><i>(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned
Clerks.)</i></p>
<p>The Great Man is, I suppose, among the most difficult themes to
treat convincingly in fiction. To name but one handicap, the author
has in such cases to postulate at least some degree of acquaintance
on the part of the reader with his celebrated subject. "Everyone is
now familiar," he will observe, "with the sensational triumph
achieved by the work of X&mdash;&mdash;;" whereat the reader,
uneasily conscious of never having heard of him, inclines to
condemn the whole business beforehand as an impossible fable. I
fancy Mr. SOMERSET MAUGHAM felt something of this difficulty with
regard to the protagonist of his quaintly-called <i>The Moon and
Sixpence</i> (HEINEMANN), since, for all his sly pretence of
quoting imaginary authorities, we have really only his unsupported
word for the superlative genius of <i>Charles Strickland</i>, the
stockbroker who abandoned respectable London to become a
Post-impressionist master, a vagabond and ultimately a Pacific
Islander. The more credit then to Mr. MAUGHAM that he does quite
definitely make us accept the fellow at his valuation. He owes
this, perhaps, to the unsparing realism of the portrait. Heartless,
utterly egotistical, without conscience or scruple or a single
redeeming feature beyond the one consuming purpose of his art,
<i>Strickland</i> is alive as few figures in recent fiction have
been; a genuinely great though repellent personality&mdash;a man
whom it would have been at once an event to have met and a pleasure
to have kicked. Mr. MAUGHAM has certainly done nothing better than
this book about him; the drily sardonic humour of his method makes
the picture not only credible but compelling. I liked especially
the characteristic touch that shows <i>Strickland</i> escaping, not
so much from the dull routine of stockbroking (genius has done that
often enough in stories before now) as from the pseudo-artistic
atmosphere of a flat in Westminster and a wife who collected blue
china and mild celebrities. <i>Mrs. Strickland</i> indeed is among
the best of the slighter characters in a tale with a singularly
small cast; though it is, of course, by the central figure that it
stands or falls. My own verdict is an unhesitating <i>stet</i>.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>If there be any who still cherish a pleasant memory of the
Bonnie Prince CHARLIE of the Jacobite legend, Miss MARJORIE BOWEN'S
<i>Mr. Misfortunate</i> (COLLINS) will dispose of it. She gives us
a study of the YOUNG PRETENDER in the decade following Culloden.
Figures such as LOCHIEL, KEITH, GORING, the dour KELLY, HENRY
STUART, LOUIS XV., with sundry courtiers and mistresses, move
across the film. I should say the author's sympathy is with her
main subject, but her conscience is too much for her. I find myself
increasingly exercised over this conscience of Miss BOWEN'S. She
seems to me to be deliberately committing herself to what I can
only describe as a staccato method. This was notably the case with
<i>The Burning Glass</i>, her last novel. Her narratives no longer
seem to flow. She will give you catalogues of furniture and
raiment, with short scenes interspersed, for all the world as if
she were transcribing from carefully taken notes. Quite probably
she is, and I am being authentically instructed and should be duly
grateful, but I find myself longing for the exuberance of her
earlier method. I feel quite sure this competent author can find a
way of respecting historical truth without killing the full-blooded
flavour of romance.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>There is a smack of the Early Besantine about the earnest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page372" id="page372"></a>[pg
372]</span> scion of a noble house who decides to share the lives
and lot of common and unwashed men with an eye to the imminent
appearance of the True Spirit of Democracy in our midst. Such a one
is the hero of Miss MAUD DIVER'S latest novel, <i>Strange Roads</i>
(CONSTABLE); but it is only fair to say that <i>Derek Blunt</i>
(<i>n&eacute;</i> Blount), second son of the <i>Earl of
Avonleigh</i>, is no prig, but, on the contrary, a very pleasant
fellow. For a protagonist he obtrudes himself only moderately in a
rather discursive story which involves a number of other people who
do nothing in particular over a good many chapters. We are halfway
through before <i>Derek</i> takes the plunge, and then we find,
him, not in the slums of some industrial quarter, but in Western
Canada, where class distinctions are founded less on soap than on
simoleons. At the end of the volume the War has "bruk out," and our
hero, apart from having led a healthy outdoor life and chivalrously
married and been left a widower by a pathetic child with
consumption and no morals, is just about where he started. I say
"at the end of the volume," for there I find a publisher's note to
the effect that in consequence of the paper shortage the further
adventures of our hero have been postponed to a subsequent volume.
It is to be entitled <i>The Strong Hours</i>, and will doubtless
provide a satisfactory <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> for all the other
people who did nothing in particular in Vol. I.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>If you had numbered <i>Elizabeth</i>, the heroine of <i>A Maiden
in Malaya</i> (MELROSE), among your friends, I can fancy your
calling upon her to "hear about her adventures in the East." I can
see her delightedly telling you of the voyage, of the people she
met on board (including the charming young man upon whom you would
already have congratulated her), of how he and she bought curios at
Port Said, of her arrival, of her sister's children and their
quaint sayings, of Singapore and its sights, of Malaya and how she
was taken to see the tapping on a rubber plantation&mdash;here I
picture a gleam of revived interest, possibly financial in origin,
appearing in your face&mdash;of the club, of dinner parties and a
thousand other details, all highly entertaining to herself and
involving a sufficiency of native words to impress the
stay-at-home. And perhaps, just as you were considering your chance
of an escape before tea, she would continue "and now I must tell
you all about the dreadful time I had in the rising!" which she
would then vivaciously proceed to do; and not only that, but all
about the dreadful time (the same dreadful time) that all her
friends had in the same rising, chapters of it, so that in the end
it might be six o'clock or later before you got away. I hope this
is not an unfair <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of the impression
produced upon me by Miss ISOBEL MOUNTAIN'S prattling pages. To sum
up, if you have an insatiable curiosity for the small talk of other
people's travel, <i>A Maiden in Malaya</i> may not prove too much
for it. If otherwise, otherwise.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>I wish Col. JOHN BUCHAN could have been jogging Mrs. A.C.
INCHBOLD'S elbow while she was writing <i>Love and the Crescent</i>
(HUTCHINSON), All the essential people in his <i>Greenmantle</i>,
which deals, towards the end at any rate, with just about the same
scenes and circumstances as her story, are so confoundedly
efficient, have so undeniably learnt the trick of making the most
of their dashing opportunities. In Mrs. INCHBOLD's book the trouble
is that with much greater advantages in the way of local knowledge
and with all manner of excitement, founded on fact, going
a-begging, nothing really thrilling or convincing ever quite
materialises. The heroine, Armenian and beautiful, is as
ineffective as the hero, who is French and heroic, both of them
displaying the same unfortunate tendency to be carried off captive
by the other side and to indulge in small talk when they should be
most splendid. And the majority of the other figures follow suit.
On the face of it the volume is stuffed with all the material of
melodrama; but somehow the authoress seems to strive after effects
that don't come naturally to her. What does come naturally to her
is seen in a background sketch of the unhappy countries of Asia
Minor in the hands of the Turk and the Hun, which is so much the
abler part of the book that one would almost rather the too
intrusive narrative were brushed aside entirely. Personally, at any
rate, I think I should prefer Mrs. INCHBOLD in essay or historical
form.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Madame ALBANESI, in <i>Tony's Wife</i> (HOLDEN AND HARDINGHAM),
has provided her admirers with a goodly collection of sound
Albanesians, but she has also given them a villain in whom, I
cannot help thinking, they will find themselves hard-pressed to
believe. <i>Richard Savile</i> was deprived of a great inheritance
by <i>Tony's</i> birth, and as his guardian spent long years in
nourishing revenge. He was not, we know, the first guardian to play
this game, but that he could completely deceive so many people for
such a long time seems to prove him far cleverer than appears from
any actual evidence furnished. If, however, this portrait is not in
the artist's best manner, I can praise without reserve the picture
of <i>Lady F&eacute;o</i>, a little Society butterfly, very
frivolous on the surface, but concealing a lot of nice intuition
and sympathy, and I welcome her as a set-off to the silly
caricatures we commonly get of the class to which she belonged. Let
me add that in the telling of this tale Madame ALBANESI retains her
quiet and individual charm.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
